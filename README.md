# SentiFocloir
Senti-Foclóir is an Irish language (Gaeilge) sentiment lexicon containing 5571 words at present. It is based on the AFINN-111 sentiment lexicon which was manually translated from English to Irish.

Each word (or multi-word expression e.g. 'le do thoil') appears on a new line and is separated from its sentiment score by a TAB character. The words are scored according to polarity, with -5 = most negative and +5 = most positive.

Efforts were made to include as many different morphological forms of each term as possible, i.e. those modified by séimhiú (lenition) and urú (eclipsis).

The lexicon also contains the most common forms of each verb that is included. Most verbs appear in the lexicon in the following tenses: past, past-passive, present, present (1st person), present-passive, future, future-passive. In future the lexicon may be extended to include other tenses such as conditional, subjunctive etc.
